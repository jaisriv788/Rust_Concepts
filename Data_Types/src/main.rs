// `#[allow(unused_variables)]` is a compiler directive in Rust that suppresses warnings related to
// unused variables. This attribute tells the Rust compiler to ignore warnings that would typically be
// generated when variables are declared but not used in the code. It can be helpful during development
// to avoid unnecessary noise from the compiler about variables that are intentionally left unused.
